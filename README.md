# blogs

This is a project that I did using react, nodeJS, and MongoDB. The blog application allows users to save information about interesting blogs they come across on the internet. Each blog will save the author, title, URL, and amount of upvotes from users of the app.  Here I am using my 'Bloglist' model in my API in order to execute my CRUD functionality.  I make sure to provide the UI with the correct error code and responses in order to have a good user experience.
